# üåø LiteFarm-MDS-Capstone

## üëÄ Challenge and Our vision  
Climate change poses a critical challenge to the sustainability of our planet, largely due to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agriculture is a major contributor, with activities such as livestock rearing, fertilizer use, and land management practices contributing heavily to GHG emissions. Quantifying agricultural GHG emissions can help optimize farming practices from crop selection to tillage methods, thereby reducing emissions. Our broader objective is to empower stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions, transforming sustainability into a measurable and actionable goal.

## üí° Project Overview  
The project aims to refine and enhance existing GHG modeling for the LiteFarm platform, specifically focusing on nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) emissions. The project has two main objectives. First, the initiative aims to improve existing modeling framework to incorporate dynamic global data for greater accuracy and broader applicability. Second, the project will conduct sensitivity analysis to identify influential factors on emissions estimation to guide targeted data collection. Deliverables will feature an updated dashboard for visualizing emissions and a Python script for automated data integration and GHG calculation. Ultimately, we aim to provide actionable insights for stakeholders, aiding decision-making in sustainable agricultural practices.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:yhan178/LiteFarm-MDS-Capstone.git
```

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.

### Step 2: Create and Activate the Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment using the `environment.yaml` file provided in this repository. To create the environment, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `environment.yml` file is located. Then, run the following command:

``` bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml

$ conda activate LiteFarmGHG
```

### Step 3: Running the N<sub>2</sub>O Emission Calculator (Farmer's Mode)

Once you have set up your environment and are ready to run the calculator, you can execute `main.py`. 

#### Explanation of Command-Line Arguments

Below are detailed descriptions of each command-line argument you can use with the N<sub>2</sub>O Emission Calculator.

- **-i, --input** (required): Path to the input CSV file that contains necessary farm data for calculation. Ensure that this path points to a valid CSV file containing the required data structure.

- **--farm_id** (required): Unique identifier for the farm. This ID must correspond to one listed in the provided input CSV file. The program will use this ID to fetch relevant data from the file.

- **-o, --output**  (optional): Name of the output JSON file where the results will be saved. If this argument is not specified, the program will default to saving the results in `output.json` in the `outputs` directory. 

- **--mode** (optional): This argument defines the precision level of the climate parameters, specifically precipitation and evapotranspiration, used in the calculations. The operational modes available are:
   - `default`: This mode uses climate data aggregated at the ecodistrict level. If not specified, the mode will default to `default` mode.
   - `precise`: Select this mode to obtain climate data specific to the exact farm location. This setting provides potentially more accurate emissions calculations.
 
##### Viewing Help Information
You can also view the help message for details about the command-line arguments with the following command:

```bash
$ python src/main.py --help
```

#### Usage Example

To calculate emissions, specify the farm ID, input file path, output file name, and mode (`default` or `precise`). You can enter these parameters in any order. Ensure the input file path is relative to the root of the project. Here are two examples:

Run the calculator with default output filename and mode:

```bash
$ python src/main.py -i data/test/litefarm_test.csv --farm_id 0369f026-1f90-11ee-b788-0242ac150004
```

Run the calculator with default mode using climate data at the ecodistrict level:

``` bash
$ python src/main.py -i data/test/litefarm_test.csv --farm_id 0369f026-1f90-11ee-b788-0242ac150004 -o my_farm_default_climate_data.json
```

Run the calculator with precise mode using climate data specific to farm location:

``` bash
$ python src/main.py -i data/test/litefarm_test.csv --farm_id 0369f026-1f90-11ee-b788-0242ac150004 --mode precise -o my_farm_precise_climate_data.json
```
