## üëÄ Challenge and Our vision  
Climate change poses a critical challenge to the sustainability of our planet, largely due to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agriculture is a major contributor, with activities such as livestock rearing, fertilizer use, and land management practices contributing heavily to GHG emissions. Quantifying agricultural GHG emissions can help optimize farming practices from crop selection to tillage methods, thereby reducing emissions. Our broader objective is to empower stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions, transforming sustainability into a measurable and actionable goal.

## üí° Project Overview  
The project aims to refine and enhance existing GHG modeling for the LiteFarm platform, specifically focusing on nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) emissions. The project has two main objectives. First, the initiative aims to improve existing modeling framework to incorporate dynamic global data for greater accuracy and broader applicability. Second, the project will conduct sensitivity analysis to identify influential factors on emissions estimation to guide targeted data collection. Deliverables will feature an updated dashboard for visualizing emissions and a Python script for automated data integration and GHG calculation. Ultimately, we aim to provide actionable insights for stakeholders, aiding decision-making in sustainable agricultural practices.
