# 🌿 LiteFarm-MDS-Capstone

## 👀 Challenge and Our vision  

Climate change remains a pressing global issue, with agriculture significantly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Farmers play a crucial role in mitigating this impact through informed agricultural practices. However, they often lack the scientific support to balance economic and environmental benefits effectively. Our vision with PyHolos is to provide a robust, accessible tool that empowers farmers and researchers to assess greenhouse gas emissions, aiding in the adoption of practices that benefit both the planet and farmers' livelihood.

## 💡 Project Overview  

PyHolos is an initiative to enhance the Holos model developed in Python, focusing on calculation of nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) emissions from crop residues. Our project enhances the original Holos model by offering cross-platform compatibility and the ability to integrate external data inputs and user-defined parameters. Additionally, PyHolos introduces features for conducting sensitivity analysis to assess uncertainties and identify research opportunities, enhancing the accuracy of emission estimates. Designed for both agricultural researchers and practitioners, PyHolos equips users with reliable, actionable data for informed decision-making in sustainable agriculture.  

For more detailed information on the development and capabilities of PyHolos, please refer to our [final report](https://github.com/yhan178/LiteFarm-MDS-Capstone/blob/main/reports/final_report_static/final_report.pdf).


## 📖 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:yhan178/LiteFarm-MDS-Capstone.git
```

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.

### Step 2: Create and Activate the Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file provided in this repository. To create the environment, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `environment.yml` file is located. Then, run the following command:

``` bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml

$ conda activate LiteFarmGHG
```

### Step 3: Download Supporting Data  

After cloning the repository, you need to download external data for finer resolution global soil texture analysis. Please follow these steps to download and set up the data:

#### Download the Data:  

Visit the following link to download the raster file for Harmonized World Soil Database v2.0:
[HWSD2 RASTER Data](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.gaezdev.aws.fao.org/HWSD/HWSD2_RASTER.zip).

#### Extract the Files:  

Once the download is complete, unzip the file. You should have the following four files: `HWSD2.bil`, `HWSD2.hdr`, `HWSD2.prj`, `HWSD2.stx`.

#### Place the Files in the Repository:  

Navigate to the `data/external/HWSD2_RASTER` directory within the cloned repository. If this directory does not exist, create it. Move all extracted files into this directory.

For more details about the dataset, including its structure and usage, visit the [Harmonized World Soil Database v2.0](https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v20/en/). By following these steps, you ensure that the project has the necessary data to perform analysis.

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Running the N<sub>2</sub>O Emission Calculator - Farmer's Mode

Run the calculator with default operation mode (farmer), source (default climate data at the ecodistrict level) with default output filename (output.json). The output file is stored in folder `data/outputs`:

```bash
$ python src/main.py -i data/test/hypothetical_farm_data.csv --farm_id farm1 --crop Soybean
```

Run the calculator with default operation mode (farmer) and external source (external sources for climate and soil data specific to farm location) with user-define file name. The output file is stored in folder `data/outputs`:

``` bash
$ python src/main.py -i data/test/hypothetical_farm_data.csv --farm_id farm1 --crop Soybean --operation_mode farmer --source external -o my_farm_precise_climate_data.json
```

### 2. Running the N<sub>2</sub>O Emission Calculator - Scientific Mode

Run the calculator with sensitivity analysis settings. The output file is stored in folder `data/outputs`:

``` bash
$ python src/main.py -i data/test/hypothetical_farm_data.csv --farm_id farm1 --crop Soybean --operation_mode scientific --source external --num_runs 100 -o farm_100_run_sci_mode.json
```

### Explanation of Command-Line Arguments

Below are detailed descriptions of each command-line argument you can use with the N<sub>2</sub>O Emission Calculator.

- **-i, --input** (required): Specifies the path to the input file, which can be either a CSV or JSON file containing the necessary farm data for calculations.
  - Additionally, if you need to create farm records interactively, you can use the `input_farm_record.py` script located in the `scripts` folder. This script allows you to manually enter new farm data, which will be saved to a JSON file as new records. You can also use script `generate_farm_data.py` in the `scripts` folder to manually add new farm record to a JSON file. 

- **--farm_id** (required): Specifies the unique identifier for the farm. This identifier must match one listed in the input CSV or JSON file. The program uses this ID in conjunction with `--crop` to precisely locate and retrieve the farm's data.

- **--crop** (required): Specifies the type of crop planted at the farm. This crop name must be one associated with the specified `farm_id` in the input CSV or JSON file. Together, the `farm_id` and `crop` serve as keys to fetch the detailed data needed for calculations.

- **-o, --output**  (optional): Name of the output JSON file where the results will be saved. If this argument is not specified, the program will default to saving the results in `output.json` in the `outputs` directory. 

- **--operation_mode** (optional): Choose between `farmer` and `scientific` operational modes:
  - `farmer`: Standard operational mode, designed to provide definitive N<sub>2</sub>O emissions calculations based on specified farm data. This mode delivers clear, final results for each run, ideal for everyday farming decisions.
  - `scientific`: Designed for research purposes, this mode facilitates a sensitivity analysis by performing multiple simulations (defined by `num_runs`) to explore how various parameters influence N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. This approach helps identify critical factors affecting emissions estimates.

- **--source** (optional): This argument defines the precision level of the climate parameters, specifically precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil texture, used in the calculations. The operational modes available are:
  - `default`: This mode uses climate data aggregated at the ecodistrict level. If not specified, the mode will default to `default` mode.
  - `external`: Select this mode to obtain climate data specific to the exact farm location as well (and the sampled points in `scientific` operation mode). This setting provides potentially more accurate emissions calculations. Mandatory for `scientific` mode.

- **--num_runs** (optional): Number of simulation runs, applicable only in `scientific` mode.

- **--sampl_modifier**, **--sampl_crop**, **--sampl_crop_group** (optional): Define how parameters are sampled in scientific mode, adjusting the variability and distribution of model inputs:
  - `default`: Currently uses a uniform distribution ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 times the base value of each parameter, providing a balanced range of variability.
  - `user_define`: Allows users to specify custom parameter distributions. Editable Python scripts for defining distribution of parameters are located in the `scripts` folder, and the generated distributions are stored as JSON files in folder `data/params_sampling_range`. Users should adjust these distributions as needed prior to executing this program to tailor the sensitivity analysis to research requirements.
