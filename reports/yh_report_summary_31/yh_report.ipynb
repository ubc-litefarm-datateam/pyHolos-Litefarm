    "# Executive summary\n",
    "In collaboration with LiteFarm, we developed PyHolos, a Python-based model designed to enhance greenhouse gas emissions calculations, specifically for nitrous oxide. PyHolos integrates seamlessly with the existing LiteFarm framework. It also incorporates external data sources and allows for user-defined parameter ranges, offering improvements over the original Holos model. This product not only provides farmers with emissions estimates for informed decision-making, but also assists researchers by facilitating uncertainty analysis for parameters and regions with significant data variability. While PyHolos is robust, the emission estimates have shown minor discrepancies compared to those of the original Holos software. We recommend ongoing communication with the Holos team for further improvement."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "Climate change presents a major challenge for our planet, with agriculture significantly contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through activities such as livestock farming, fertilizer application, and land management practices [@johnson2007agricultural]. Farmers are central to addressing this challenge, as their choices in crop selection and farming practices directly impact carbon emissions and the environmental footprint [@jantke2020agricultural]. Agricultural choices are influenced by immediate profits, long-term soil health, and the financial benefits of conservation and sustainability programs. Carbon credit, for example, offers farmers the opportunity to earn extra revenue by adopting practices that reduce carbon emissions [@barbato2023farmer]. However, farmers lack scientific support to balance financial losses from less profitable crops with gains from carbon credits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing this gap, our partner, the LiteFarm team, leads the way in agricultural innovation. Comprising a diverse group of researchers and developers, they aim to empower farmers, researchers, and policymakers with data-driven tools to make sustainability tangible and actionable. They have developed an application that helps farmers manage daily operations, boosting their income while also encouraging environmentally friendly practices. Now, the team plans to enhance the app by integrating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculations to further support sustainable farming decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting a suitable GHG emissions calculation model is crucial for this task. The LiteFarm team chose the Holos model due to its open-source nature and its endorsement by the Canadian government for reliability [@Holos2022]. Unlike commercial models, Holos offers a reliable and free alternative. However, this model has limitations: it operates as a standalone tool and cannot be directly integrated with the LiteFarm framework. It runs exclusively on Windows OS and is developed in C#, restricting its wider usability. Moreover, its fixed parameters limit the model's flexibility and adaptability for incorporating data from new or alternative sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to integrate the Holos GHG emission calculation module into the LiteFarm framework, focusing on nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) emissions from crop residue. We enhance the existing Holos model to better align with our partner’s needs and goals. Our objectives are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Model Reconstruction: We aim to rebuild the Holos model in Python for smoother integration with LiteFarm. This shift ensures better compatibility with the app’s existing framework and offers more accessibility and versatility than the original Holos software.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Enhanced Flexibility: We aim to enhance the Holos model for parameter sampling from external data sources or user-defined distributions. This adjustment increases flexibility in model parameterization, adapting to diverse global agricultural environments. Including external data fits our partner’s global research scope and mitigates data scarcity in under-researched regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Improved Reliability through Sensitivity Analysis: With the enhanced model, we conduct sensitivity analyses to understand how input variations affect GHG emission estimates. This process is vital for identifying and minimizing uncertainties, thereby helping our partner pinpoint research gaps and provide farmers with accurate, reliable data for informed decision-making."

    "## Model development: PyHolos  \n",
    "\n",
    "We developed the PyHolos model to calculate nitrous oxide emissions from crop residues. After thoroughly reviewing the original Holos model code and technical reports, we identified 12 groups of equations and 24 parameters (Appendix @tbl-params). Our goal with PyHolos is to keep the core functions of the Holos model while tailoring it to better meet our partner's needs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Reconstruction  \n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate the original Holos outputs, we reconstructed the Holos model within PyHolos. The model consists of two key components: a Data Loader and a Calculator. Both components are broken down into smaller, manageable steps to enhance structure and functionality. The Data Loader imports parameter values organized into specific categories, while the Calculator processes these values in stages, allowing for intermediate result storage and accuracy validation against the original model outputs (@fig-structure-conceptual).  \n",

    "\n",
    "For climate parameters, we use API calls to access the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Prediction of World Wide Energy Resources (NASA/POWER; http://power.larc.nasa.gov), and for soil data, we use the Harmonized World Soil Database [@nachtergaele2023harmonized]. These enhancements offer global coverage and refined data resolution, boosting the model’s accuracy and relevance.   \n",

    "We conducted a sensitivity analysis with real farm locations. Unlike the original Holos model, which uses average climate and soil parameters from broad regions known as ecodistricts, PyHolos samples point-specific data from each farm's corresponding ecodistrict. This approach assesses uncertainties associated with the Holos model and provides a detailed view of how environmental factors affect calculation. For other fixed variables in Holos where domain knowledge is lacking, we varied parameters by ±25% using a uniform distribution.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We also tested the model’s robustness with a hypothetical dataset of 105 farms, each growing three different crop types. For each crop at each farm, we generated 100 samples for each parameter to assess how different parameters affect the model's outputs.\n"
